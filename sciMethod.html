          <h1 id="two">Ask a Question or Make an Observation</h1>
        </div>
        <h3 id="instructions">What question would you like to try to and answer, what do you wonder about?</h3>
        <h4 id="example">EXAMPLE: When the seasons change will the leaves change colors too?</h4>

          <h1 id="two">Form A Hypothesis</h1>
        </div>
        <h3 id="instructions">What do you think the answer to your question is? Don't worry about being right, just make your best educated guess.</h3>
        <h4 id="example">EXAMPLE: I think the leaves will change colors as it gets colder?</h4>

          <h1 id="two">Gather Your Materials</h1>
        </div>
        <h3 id="instructions">Collect the materials you will need to conduct your experiment.</h3>
        <h4 id="example">EXAMPLE: gather data collection charts, choose which trees to observe.</h4>

      <section class="stepFour">
        <h1 id="one">Step 4</h1>
        <div class="titleline">
          <h1 id="two">Follow The Procedure</h1>
        </div>
        <h3 id="instructions">Complete your experiment by preforming tests and following those exact same steps everytime.</h3>
        <h4 id="example">EXAMPLE: everyday Tuesday the exact same time for 12 months, go and observe the color of the leaves on a variety of different trees. Record the exact time, temperature, and observations about the color of the leaves in your data table .</h4>

      <section class="stepFive">
        <h1 id="one">Step 5</h1>
        <div class="titleline">
          <h1 id="two">Observe and Collect Data</h1>
        </div>
        <h3 id="instructions">What did you observe (observe using your five sense: See, Hear, Feel, Smell, Taste). Record ALL your observations.</h3>
        <h4 id="example">EXAMPLE: Observe the color of the leaves, record, temperature and other environmental factors that you predict might effect the color.</h4>

        <h1 id="one">Step 6</h1>
        <div class="titleline">
          <h1 id="two">Draw Conclusions</h1>
        </div>
        <h3 id="instructions">Based on the data you collected, was your Hypothesis proven correct or incorrect, why? What did you learn? </h3>
        <h4 id="example">EXAMPLE: after observing several trees over the course of the year, I conclude that while the colors of the leaves on certain trees do change before they fall off, not all trees change colors. Therefore, my Hypothesis was proven <em>partially</em> correct.</h4>
